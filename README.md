# Linked Lists in C++

This repository is your one-stop shop for mastering linked lists in C++! It provides clear explanations, code examples, and a curated list of practice problems from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks to solidify your understanding.

# Sections:

### Introduction :

Define Linked Lists: linear data structures where elements (nodes) contain data and a reference (pointer) to the next node, forming a chain.

Explain their advantages (dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertion/deletion) and disadvantages (random access) compared to arrays.

### Node Structure :

Design a Node class to represent a linked list node:

Data member to store the node's value

Pointer (next) to the next node in the list (nullptr for the tail)

### Operations :

Code examples demonstrating fundamental operations:

Creation of a linked list (including dynamic allocation)

Insertion of elements (at the beginning, end, or a specific position)

Deletion of elements (head, tail, or a specific node)

Searching for a specific value

Reversing the linked list (iterative and recursive approaches, if applicable)

### Types of Linked Lists :

Explore different linked list variations: 

Singly Linked List (standard linked list with one pointer per node)

Doubly Linked List (each node has pointers to both the previous and next node)

Circular Linked List (tail node points back to the head)

Implement basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal) for each type, highlighting their advantages and use cases.
